Research AMP is a free, open-source technology for building scholarly communities, collecting research, and sharing insights with new audiences. Research AMP lowers barriers to the dissemination of public scholarship and fills the need to put credible, accessible, and comprehensive scholarship in the hands of expert and lay audiences. 

Research AMP helps you: 

Curate scholarly literature about your topic in a public [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) library, and create new articles and research reviews using that literature

Collate news articles and reports are collated through [PressForward](https://pressforward.org/), and present them on your Research AMP site. 

Organize both collated and original content on your Research AMP site. Research topics and tags make it easy to organize this information and make it legible to your audience. 

More information, and a link to the documentation and technical information about the platform, can be found at [https://ramp.ssrc.org/](https://ramp.ssrc.org). Research AMP requires a fresh WordPress installation on a host site. Instructions for use are found in our documentation. 

The Research AMP plugin is developed and maintained by the [Social Science Research Council](https://www.ssrc.org/) as part of the [Research AMP](https://ramp.ssrc.org/) project, generously funded by the [Mellon Foundation](https://www.mellon.org/). 

Research AMP was designed by Sonja Leix and developed by Boone Gorges. It is free to use and modify under a [GNU GPL2 license](http://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/gpl-2.0.html).
